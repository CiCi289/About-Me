- 👋 Hi, I’m @CiCi289.

- 😊 I am an University student majoring in Business administration and English (Distance). 

- 👀 I’m interested in drawing abstracts, mandalas, zentangles,doodling, painting, making artworks as my mind direct, 3D artworks and designs. 
  In a nut shell, i'm interested in Art & Design pretty much.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web Design (Figma, HTML, CSS) and i will continue learning JavaScript and other things once i can handle fundamental CSS well.

- 🙄 You might want to ask me... What do you do and How did you become interested in Web Design/Ui-Ux/ Front-End Web development?<br>
- 😁  In 2020 and 2021, i was a 3D artist. I was learning 3d, making 3d artworks, learning abit of 2D on one hand and making some new friends in Comics & 3D field,
  collaborating in two large Comic book projects as a Previz, 3d layout and composition artist for my Comics artist friends. 
  And Yes, the Comics book "Crimson Hill" was released in 2021 from our group, Tale Machine. You can check it out. <br><br>
      My Elder brother is a Software Engineer and Web Developer. He introduced me to Figma during end of 2021 while universities were 
  still shut down due to Covid-19 and Coup in my country. I realized i love making Website Designs prototypes for both Desktop and Mobiles. 
  I started learning Design Principles on the other hand. And like that... I started learning HTML and CSS on January, 2022. 
  I love seeing the code line i wrote being rendere as visuals on web browser so much. I would love it more if i can do it functional and helpful for others.
  May be this could be my passion on Web design and development.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basic HTML, CSS related things. Well, as i am quite newbie.
